# Useful Tools

[HTTP Bin](http://httpbin.org/#/) is a useful website that provides a live service to return standard responses for specific HTTP requests.  HTTP Bin has recently updated its look and provides a Docker image so you can run their service in your own Docker environment.

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

# Configuration Management
